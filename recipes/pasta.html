        <li>When the dough comes together, shape it into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>After the dough rests, slice it into 4 pieces.</li>
        <li>Use a rolling pin or your hands to gently flatten one into an oval disk.</li>
        <li>Then, run it through the widest setting of your pasta maker</li>
        <li>Next, fold the doughâ€¦ if you want to.</li>
        <li>Then, fold it in half lengthwise to form a rectangle.</li>
